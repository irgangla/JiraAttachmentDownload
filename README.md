# JiraAttachmentDownload
Chrome Extension: JIRA Attachment Downloader

Download all attachments of any JIRA ticket with one click.

The Popup allows choosing which attachment should be downloaded. The found attachments can be search also using regular expressions and a additional link filter can be defined to find external, linked attachments. The setting for this filter is persisted per domain. The attachments are saved into the default download folder as <JIRA project>/<JIRA ticket id>/<filename>.
